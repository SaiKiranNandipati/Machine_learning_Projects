## Introduction
The SMS Spam Detector leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for text classification. The project preprocesses text data, trains an SVM model, evaluates its performance, and provides a GUI for easy interaction.

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- NLTK
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- tkinter

Install the required packages using:
```sh
pip install numpy pandas nltk scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tkinter
